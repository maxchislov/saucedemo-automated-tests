# Test cases

The test cases are written in TypeScript. All elements being used in tests are stored in the `selectors.json` file, which makes it easier to maintain tests in the future, and also makes the code cleaner and easier to remember which elements are used.


## Purchase flow

This test checks the successful purchase flow. The test covers the most important core functionality of the web app.


## Login page validation

This test verifies that the system behaves correctly when attempts are made to incorrectly log in using invalid credentials. This is an important test of the system behavior by checking negative scenarios.


## Screen sizes registration 

This test verifies that the purchasing process works correctly with different screen resolutions. Besides the functional testing, it's still important to make sure that the app works for different setups. 
Here I used the most popular screen resolutions according to [Worldwide Screen Resolution Stats (Jan 2020 â€“ Jan 2021)](https://gs.statcounter.com/screen-resolution-stats)


Test cases can be run in different browsers, in a Readme file, there is detailed info regarding it.
